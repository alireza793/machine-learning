This project working on 2 parts  of dataset with CSV files.
it's about NLP .
Our files one is about True news and another is about Fake News.
this Dataset is real data . It's doesn't have any missing value so it makes it easier for using algorithms.
I chosen logistics Regression for it because our data is like binary type . 
I mean : we have text as a true or false thing so it's classification 0 and 1 and logistics is one of the best for ot.
