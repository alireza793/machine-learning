# Earthquake and Tsunami Prediction 🌍

This project focuses on **predicting earthquakes and tsunamis** using real-world data.  
The dataset (`Earthquake.csv`) contains information about past earthquakes and related parameters.

## 📊 Overview
I implemented two different machine learning models in this project:

1. **Earthquake Magnitude Prediction**
   - Goal: Predict the magnitude of an earthquake using available features.
   - Implementation: Python (`Earthquake.py`).
   - Algorithms: Various regression models tested and compared.

2. **Tsunami Prediction**
   - Goal: Predict the possibility of a tsunami occurrence based on earthquake parameters.
   - Target variable: Whether a tsunami happened or not.
   - Type: Classification problem.

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `Earthquake.csv` | Dataset used for model training |
| `Earthquake.py` | Source code for model implementation |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add deep learning models for better prediction accuracy  
- Visualize correlations between magnitude and tsunami occurrence  
- Extend dataset with real-time seismic data
